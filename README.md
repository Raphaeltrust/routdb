# Session info

As per the development of RoutDB, it is easy to use. RoutDB works with built-in session function. The session enables RoutDB to communicate with your server as well as to give access to pull, delete, and manage databases on the server.
RoutDB session is made up of four componets:
<ol><li><strong>Session name:</strong> The session name is used to create a secured environment where you can only have access to the server, without a session name you won't be able to access any part of the database area. The session name acts like a login password but doesn't store the session name in a database, this is because of security issues. To improve security issues we attempt not to store user session which mean when you close your browser window the session will be erased.You have to create a new session name each time you want to access the database area. 
Session name can contain letters, you can name your session name with any name of your choice, it could be your name or something else. The session name is just a reference to create a secured environment.</li>
<li><strong>Server Name:</strong> The servername refers to you server address, if you install routDB on a local machine, your server name should be "localhost". The server name is required to locate your server as well as connecting to the server. Always make sure you input the correct server name.</li>
<li><strong>Username:</strong> This refers to your server username example " root@localhost or "root" depending on your server configuration you need to input the correct username.</li>
<li><strong>Password:</strong> This refers to your server password<li></ol>
